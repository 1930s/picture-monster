DESCRIPTION
       picture-monster is an utility program used for crawling Web  pages  and
       downloading  images embedded in them.  The program starts crawling from
       a given set of URLs and follows links in the content of those pages  up
       to  the  depth  specified  by  the user, collecting images found on the
       pages along the way.  Upon reaching the desired depth of the tree,  the
       program starts downloading the images found to the hard disk.

       The  new subcommand is used to start a new crawling session.  The mini‐
       mal parameters required to start crawling are: the starting set of URLs
       and  the  maximum search depth.  Upon executing the new subcommand, the
       program will produce an output Markdown file containing a report on the
       progress  of  the  crawling  process.  The file produced can be used to
       resume a started session at a later date after interrupting it.

       The continue subcommand is used to resume a crawling  session  from  an
       existing  crawling report.  Upon resuming, files that have already been
       downloaded will not be downloaded again.

              Total maximum number of outgoing connections.  Must be  a  posi‐
              tive value.

       -l, --limit-per-host PER_HOST
              Maximum  number  of connections to single host.  Must be a posi‐

       -x, --extension EXT

              fied extension will be saved to disk.

              Target  directory to which the images found should be saved.  If
              omitted, images will be saved in the current working directory.

       -o, --output OUT_FILE
              Output Markdown file that will contain the crawling report.  The
              file  can  be used to continue an interrupted session at a later

       Options for the continue subcommand:
